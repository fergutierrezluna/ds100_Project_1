    "\n",
    "This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing data set that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in part A, we will guide you through some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. Next, you will be adding a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part B, you will specify and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. Finally, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.\n",

Other than taxation purposes, motivations from the public sector might include collecting demographic data, academic research, city planning, resource allocation for public infrastructure investment, social programs, among others. Private parties that might be interested include real estate companies, law firms and commercial entities for profit purposes, market data and strategic decision making. Given that there are so many parties interested in this data, there might be problems in the collection of this data.

    "This data set was collected by the [Cook County Assessor's Office](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Archive-Cook-County-Assessor-s-Residential-Sales-D/5pge-nu6u) in order to build a model to predict the monetary value of a home (if you didn't put this for your answer for Question 1 Part 2, please don't go back and change it - we wanted speculation!). You can read more about data collection in the CCAO’s [Residential Data Integrity Preliminary Report](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/ccao_sf_cama_dev/-/blob/master/documentation/Preliminary%20Report%20on%20Data%20Integrity%20June%207,%202019.pdf). In part 2 of this project you will be building a linear model that predict sales prices using training data but it's important to first understand how the structure of the data informs such a model. In this section, we will make a series of exploratory visualizations and feature engineering in preparation for that prediction task.\n",

    "### Sale Price\n",
    "We begin by examining the distribution of our target variable `SalePrice`.  At the same time, we also take a look at some descriptive statistics of this variable. We have provided the following helper method `plot_distribution` that you can use to visualize the distribution of the `SalePrice` using both the histogram and the box plot at the same time. Run the following 2 cells and describe what you think is wrong with the visualization."

This is because it is using the max value and min value as the limits for the x-axis, and those values are large outliers affecting all of the data. We can see these outliers values in the `training_data['Sale Price'].describe()` results, where the mean is 2.451646e+05 while the max is 7.100000e+07 and the min is 1.000000e+00.

Also, there are neighborhoods with higher number of outliers than others. This might be because of houses themselves in the same neighborhood that vary in their characteristics, or in irregularities in the measuring system / algorithm. Another possible interpretation could be that neighborhoods with extreme outliers could have a higher contrast in their inequalities. For example, we can see that the highest outlier in the boxplots is in neighborhood 50, while its lowest outlier is similar or comparable to other neighborhoods. This might mean that there is a high concentration of wealth in the richest members, resulting in a poor money distribution."

    "Unfortunately, simply fixing these missing values isn't sufficient for using `Roof Material` in our model.  Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function `ohe_roof_material` that returns a dataframe with the new column one-hot-encoded on the roof material of the household. These new columns should have the form `Roof Material_MATERIAL`. Your function should return a new DataFrame, not modify the existing DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should **avoid using `pd.get_dummies`** in your solution as it will remove your original column and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns **using Scikit-learn's [One Hot Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)**. It's far more customizable!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: To get you started with this subpart, here is code that initializes a `OneHotEncoding` pre-processing \"model\" from Scikit-learn and fits it on a simple dataset containing (some of) the first names of your instructional staff this summer! Please play with this code before jumping into the roof material data if you are unsure how to approach the question using `OneHotEncoder`.\n",

    "In Project 1B, you will focus on building a linear model to predict home prices. You will be well-prepared to build such a model: you have considered what is in this data set, what it can be used for, and engineered some features that should be useful for prediction. Creating a house-pricing model for Cook County has some challenging social implications to think, though, however. This will be addressed in Lecture 14 on July 14 (pretty cool coincidence?!) and Thursday's discussion."
